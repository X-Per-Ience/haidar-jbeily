# 1- Introduction

* Your task is to code the index frontend.

# 2- Methods
* " X-Per-Ience / haidar-jbeily " is your repository, replace your "index.htm" with the one created by default.
* You can setup your own folders in your own mindset, for example you can place all css files inside a directory "/css",... feel free.
