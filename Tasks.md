# 1- Introduction
* You gonna work on an index page for the official website of a company called "XPerIence Marketplace".
* It is a digital store, we don't know yet how a user would prefer the index to look like, it's your task to decide how the index would look like in every detail.
* Your task is to code the index frontend.

# 2- Methods
* " X-Per-Ience / haidar-jbeily " is your repository, replace the "index.htm" created by default with your own "index.htm" (normal upload will do replacement automatically).
* You can setup your own folders in your own mindset, for example you can place all css files inside a directory "/css",... feel free.
* When you use pictures or any resources please notice to use only free & open-to-use resources, and cite the source in HTML comments (i.e. link,..).

# 3- You are a very welcomed member in our team ! feel free, let everybody see your brightness, feel loved!
